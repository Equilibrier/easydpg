# EasyDPG

Welcome to the EasyDPG project! This initiative was born out of a desire to simplify the complexities often associated with building user interfaces using DearPyGui. As a developer, I understand the challenges that come with creating intuitive and responsive UIs, and I wanted to create a solution that makes this process more accessible to everyone.

## Project Purpose

EasyDPG aims to provide a streamlined and user-friendly interface for building UIs, allowing developers to focus on functionality rather than getting bogged down by intricate details. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, EasyDPG offers tools that can help you create beautiful and responsive applications with ease.

## Key Features

- **Wrapper Elements**: Create and customize various UI components effortlessly. From buttons to text inputs, the wrapper classes simplify the construction process.
- **Responsive Layout Management**: Automated layout managers ensure that your application maintains a responsive design, similar to what you would expect in CSS. This means your UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Integration with Redux**: EasyDPG supports state management integration with Redux, enabling efficient updates to your UI components based on state changes. This feature is particularly useful for applications with complex state logic.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms are in place for error handling, providing users with clear guidance and enhancing the reliability of the application by managing unrecognized parameters and invalid rules.
- **Event Handling**: Comprehensive management of user interactions is included, allowing for dynamic updates based on user actions, such as button clicks and input changes.

## Usage Examples

EasyDPG comes with clear instructions on how to create and configure various UI components. You'll find demonstrations on creating nested child windows and managing popup messages, which enhance the structural organization of your UI.

## Technical Aspects

- The project utilizes threading for timed events in the UI, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- It implements depth-first search (DFS) algorithms to track UI elements and their relationships, making it easier to manage complex interfaces.
- The code is structured in a clean and organized manner, facilitating easy building and management of UI components.
